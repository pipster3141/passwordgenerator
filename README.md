# Password Generator
Follow the instructions on the screen to be given a new
password you can use that is secure.

The program works by taking a regular word ex: elephant
and switching the vowels w/ other vowels and the consonants
w/ other consonants so it's more memorable via pronounciation.

In that example elephant could be turned into oluphanp478
if the user opted for numbers in it. It is not possible for
the new string portion of the password to exist in the english
dictionary therefore protecting the user from dictionary attacks.
